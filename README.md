# Overview:
Itâ€™s an OpenCV project which is used to detect any wrist watches.<br />
**I trained it by creating my own harcascade for detecting wrist watches only**. It is a step towards object detection without by creating our own cascade files. As it takes time to generate a cascade file after training on images, I have made it only for detecting watches.
